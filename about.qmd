## Background

I’m Keppner—a builder, connector, and adventurer at heart. Whether it’s organizing community races like the Broke Boys Half, launching entrepreneurial ventures from surfacing pickleball courts to strategy consulting projects, or diving into global markets through my work with Mangrove Collective, I thrive on creating experiences that bring people together and make a lasting impact. Beyond business, you’ll find me outdoors—running, climbing, skiing, or documenting the world through photography. I believe success comes from curiosity, grit, and prioritizing people over numbers, and I’m driven to use my skills in strategy, business, and storytelling to build ventures that matter.
